  Majjik.el is a <a href="https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/">jujutsu</a>
  interface within <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">Emacs</a>.
  It is a fork of <a href="https://magit.vc">Magit</a>.
  Eventually, I hope Majjik will be a complete jj interface, but for now
  it's just my first dip into Emacs (and my first Lisp project since uni).
  Please be patient.

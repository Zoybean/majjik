***

Majjik.el is a [jujutsu][jj] interface within [Emacs].
It is a fork of [Magit].

Eventually, I hope Majjik will be a complete jj interface, but for now
it's just my first dip into Emacs (and my first Lisp project since uni).
Please be patient.

### Getting Started

If you are new to Majjik, but know [Magit], then it should already be familiar.
If not, a lot of the information in [Magit's Getting Started page](https://github.com/magit/magit#getting-started) may be useful.

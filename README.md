***

  Majjik.el is a [jujutsu][jj] interface within [Emacs][emacs].
  It is a fork of [Magit][magit].
  Eventually, I hope Majjik will be a complete jj interface, but for now
  it's just my first dip into Emacs (and my first Lisp project since uni).
  Please be patient.

### Getting Started

If you are new to Majjik, but know Magit, then it should already be familiar. If not, a lot of the information in Magit's [Getting Started](https://github.com/magit/magit#getting-started) may be useful.
